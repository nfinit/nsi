<strong>NSI</strong> is a simple HTML index generator and pseudo-framework for 
small websites written in Perl, intended to enforce style consistency
while also increasing flexibility when working with many static HTML pages.
</p> 
<p>
NSI began as a learning exercise to develop a simple monitoring page for an 
aging AIX system with limited language support, but it has since taken on 
a more general-purpose role with features such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Displaying preformatted file and shell script output</li>
  <li>Static HTML wrapping</li>
  <li>Dynamic table of contents generation for pages and directory trees</li>
  <li>Dynamic navigation controls</li>
  <li>...and <strong>more</strong>, as new use cases emerge</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>If you are seeing this page after cloning the NSI repository into a directory on your web server, it means NSI is working correctly and is ready to configure to your needs.</strong>
