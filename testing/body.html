<p>
NSI is designed to run on anything, targeting maximal compatibility for both
clients and servers. It should readily deploy on any properly configured
Unix-like system with a web server supporting Perl CGI execution, and has been
tested mainly with Apache, lighttpd and OpenBSD httpd on a variety of
platforms. This page serves to document NSI's testing on older or more unusual
systems, along with any caveats noted.
